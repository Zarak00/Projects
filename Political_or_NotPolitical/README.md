## Political Text Classifier
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a binary classifier that can determine whether a piece of text is political or non-political. This could be useful for tasks such as automatically categorizing news articles, social media posts, or other forms of text content.

The classifier is built using a logistic regression model and trained on a dataset of labeled political and non-political text. The text data is preprocessed using techniques such as regular expression tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization. The final model is evaluated on a test set to measure its accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled political and non-political text. The text data is sourced from various news articles and social media posts. The dataset is preprocessed to remove any HTML tags and non-alphabetic characters.

## Data Preprocessing
The text data is preprocessed using a series of techniques to prepare it for model training. The first step is to tokenize the text using regular expressions to split it into individual words. Stopword removal is then applied to remove common words such as "the" and "and" that do not provide much semantic meaning. Finally, the text is vectorized using a count vectorizer to convert it into numerical features that can be used as input to the logistic regression model.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The logistic regression model is trained on the preprocessed text data using the features generated by the count vectorizer. The trained model is then evaluated on a test set to measure its accuracy in classifying political and non-political text. The evaluation is performed using a multiclass classification evaluator with the "accuracy" metric.

## Conclusion
The political text classifier built in this project provides a way to automatically categorize text content as political or non-political. While the model's accuracy could be further improved with more data and additional preprocessing techniques, the current implementation provides a good starting point for future work in this area.
